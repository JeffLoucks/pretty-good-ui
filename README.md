# Pretty Good UI

Pretty Good UI is a WIP web component library. I'm building this for fun, and my goal is for it to be... pretty good!

This is going to be pretty unstable until I get a few more componenents in, but I will update the project with more clear instructions as it gets to a more stable spot.

Always open to constructive feedback so feel free to let me know your thoughts!

## Installation

`npm install pretty-good-ui`
